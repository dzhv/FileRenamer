# FileRenamer

You go on a holiday,
You take pictures both with your phone and your camera,
You put those photos in a single place,
Your slideshow device disregards the chronological order of the pictures and shows them sorted by file name.
Everything's a mess.

Sounds familiar?
Well fear no more, as this simple program helps you deal with this issue.
It takes a folder and renames all of the files in it by a timestamp of the file's creation date.

This way photos sorted by file name will still be in chronological order.
